| **Alternative Sequences** | **Step 3**: If booking not found, Staff tries alternative search methods, checks physical registration book, or asks guest for booking confirmation<br><br>**Step 5**: If check-out date is future (early check-out), System displays warning "Early check-out - Scheduled for [date]", Staff proceeds with early check-out, no refund for unused nights per policy<br><br>**Step 7**: If guest lost room key or access card, Staff charges key replacement fee (added to Step 9 outstanding charges), issues temporary exit pass if needed<br><br>**Step 8**: If damage found, Staff documents with photos, assesses damage cost, adds to outstanding charges, may require manager approval for significant damage<br><br>**Step 9**: If guest unable to pay outstanding charges, Staff contacts manager, may accept later payment with signed agreement, or withholds final receipt until paid<br><br>**Late Check-Out Handling**:<br>- Guest requests late check-out<br>- Staff checks room availability (next booking?)<br>- If available: Staff approves (free or for fee per property policy)<br>- If not available: Staff offers luggage storage<br>- System updates scheduled check-out time<br><br>**Express Check-Out**:<br>- Guest doesn't visit reception (early morning departure)<br>- Guest leaves key in drop box<br>- Staff processes check-out when discovered<br>- System marks check-out time as actual departure<br>- No outstanding charges collection possible (charged to card if authorized)<br><br>**Extended Stay Request**:<br>- Guest wants to extend stay beyond original check-out<br>- Staff checks room/bed availability<br>- If available: Staff creates new booking or modifies existing<br>- If not available: Staff offers alternative room or refers to nearby hostels<br><br>**Lost Property Found**:<br>- Guest left belongings in room<br>- Staff logs lost property item<br>- Staff contacts guest via email/phone<br>- Arranges shipping or pickup<br>- Lost property tracked in system<br><br>**Automatic Check-Out**:<br>- Guest doesn't check out by scheduled time<br>- Staff attempts to contact guest<br>- If no response by end of day: Staff processes check-out<br>- Bed/room released for next booking<br>- Outstanding charges handled per policy<br><br>**Group Check-Out**:<br>- Multiple guests on single booking<br>- Lead guest checks out for group<br>- Staff collects all keys from group<br>- Single check-out transaction<br><br>**Dispute Resolution**:<br>- Guest disputes additional charges<br>- Staff escalates to manager<br>- Manager reviews evidence (photos, logs)<br>- Resolution reached (waive, reduce, or uphold charge)<br>- Guest checks out after resolution |
| **Postconditions** | **Success**: Guest checked out. Booking status updated to "Completed". Check-out timestamp recorded. Bed/room released and marked for cleaning. Outstanding charges settled. Availability updated for future bookings.<br><br>**Failure**: Check-out not completed. Booking status remains "Checked-In". Issue noted for resolution. Staff escalates to manager. |
| **Nonfunctional Requirements** | **Performance**: Expected departures list loads within 2 seconds. Check-out form displays within 1 second. Check-out completion saves within 2 seconds. Availability updates immediately.<br><br>**Usability**: Check-out interface quick and efficient (minimal steps). Search by room/bed number common use case. Touch-friendly for tablet interface. Clear indicators for outstanding charges. Easy to add additional charges with preset categories (laundry, damage, etc.).<br><br>**Accuracy**: Check-out timestamp accurate. Financial calculations correct. Room/bed status updates reliable. No double-booking after release. Late check-out fees calculated per policy.<br><br>**Reliability**: Check-out works offline (sync later). Duplicate check-out prevention. Room cleaning status tracked separately from availability. Guest feedback preserved for analysis.<br><br>**Housekeeping Integration**: Room status visible to cleaning staff. Cleaning completion updates room from "Needs Cleaning" to "Clean" and "Available". Priority cleaning for immediate next bookings. |
| **Business Requirements** | BR-097: Check-out possible on or after scheduled date (early check-out allowed)<br>BR-098: Outstanding charges must be settled before check-out completion<br>BR-099: Room/bed released immediately after check-out for availability<br>BR-100: Check-out timestamp recorded for operational and legal records<br>BR-101: Guest feedback collected during check-out for quality improvement<br>BR-102: Lost property logged and tracked for minimum 30 days<br>BR-103: Late check-out fees applied per property policy (if next booking exists) |
| **Frequency of Use** | Very High (daily for active properties, multiple check-outs per day) |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Outstanding Questions** | 1. Should system send automated check-out confirmation email to guest?<br>2. Should guest be able to check out via mobile app (express check-out)?<br>3. Should system generate summary of stay (nights stayed, services used)?<br>4. Should staff be able to rate guest behavior (for future bookings)?<br>5. Should system automatically trigger review request email immediately after check-out?<br>6. Should system support contactless key return (smart locks)?<br>7. Should lost property images be stored in system for easy identification? |

## Related Use Cases

- **UC-17: Check In Guest** — Check-out completes stay cycle started by check-in
- **UC-12: Process Booking** — Check-out marks booking completion
- **UC-19: View Booking Details** — Staff views stay details during check-out
- **UC-07: Submit Review** — Guest invited to review after check-out

## Notes

- Check-out critical for releasing inventory and financial reconciliation
- Outstanding charges common in hostel operations (damages, extra services)
- Key collection prevents security issues and replacement costs
- Guest feedback during check-out provides valuable insights
- Room status tracking (occupied → needs cleaning → clean → available) essential
- Express check-out reduces staff workload for early departures
- Late check-out flexibility improves guest satisfaction when possible
- Lost property management reduces liability and improves service
- Automated check-out for no-shows prevents inventory blocking
- Check-out efficiency impacts next guest check-in experience

## Acceptance Criteria Validation

✓ **C1: Delivers useful result to primary actor** — Staff completes guest departure with charges settled and inventory released

✓ **C2: Avoids functional decomposition** — Complete check-out sequence from guest search through charge settlement to status update

✓ **C3: Maintains black box view** — No mention of status updates, availability algorithms, cleaning workflows; only describes check-out behavior

✓ **C4: Primary and secondary actors identified** — Primary: Hostel Staff (processes check-out); Secondary: None (all operations internal)
