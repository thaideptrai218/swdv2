| **Business Requirements** | BR-048: All properties require admin verification before going live<br>BR-049: Business license and tax documentation mandatory<br>BR-050: Bank account verification required for payouts<br>BR-051: Property listing commission structure disclosed in terms<br>BR-052: Owner can manage property setup while awaiting verification approval<br>BR-053: Single owner can register multiple properties (separate registrations) |
| **Frequency of Use** | Low to Medium (one-time per property, repeated for owners with multiple locations) |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Outstanding Questions** | 1. Should system support co-ownership (multiple owners for one property)?<br>2. Should system verify business registration number automatically via government API?<br>3. What is the approval rate threshold for expedited verification for established owners?<br>4. Should system support property import from existing booking platforms (Booking.com export)?<br>5. Should owner be able to register property without bank details initially (add later)?<br>6. What documentation is required for properties in different countries/regions?<br>7. Should system offer guided onboarding call for first-time property registration? |

✓ **C1: Delivers useful result to primary actor** — Owner registers property for listing on platform with clear verification process

✓ **C2: Avoids functional decomposition** — Complete registration sequence from initial form through submission to verification confirmation

✓ **C3: Maintains black box view** — No mention of database tables, file storage systems, admin dashboards; only describes registration behavior
