| **Alternative Sequences** | **Step 7**: If Owner declines booking (overbooking, property issue), Owner clicks "Decline Booking", enters reason, System cancels booking, processes refund via Payment Gateway, sends cancellation notification to guest with reason and refund details<br><br>**Step 7.2**: If room no longer available (double-booked by mistake), System displays error "Room no longer available", prevents confirmation, Owner must decline booking with refund<br><br>**Step 8.4**: If selected bed already assigned to another guest (race condition), System displays "Bed no longer available", highlights available beds, Owner selects different bed<br><br>**No-Show Flow**:<br>- Check-in time passes without guest arrival<br>- Owner marks booking as "No-Show"<br>- System updates booking status<br>- System sends no-show notification to guest via Email Service<br>- System applies no-show policy (no refund as per policy)<br>- Bed/room released for new bookings<br><br>**Early Check-In Request**:<br>- Guest contacts owner requesting early check-in<br>- Owner checks room availability<br>- If available: Owner approves, updates check-in time, sends confirmation<br>- If not available: Owner declines with explanation, offers luggage storage<br><br>**Modification Request**:<br>- Guest requests booking changes (extend stay, change room type)<br>- Owner checks availability for requested changes<br>- If available: Owner quotes price difference, guest confirms, Owner updates booking<br>- If not available: Owner declines with alternatives<br><br>**Urgent Notification Flow**:<br>- For bookings within 24 hours: System sends SMS reminder to Owner via SMS Gateway<br>- For new bookings: System sends immediate SMS alert via SMS Gateway<br>- For cancellations: System sends urgent SMS notification via SMS Gateway |
| **Postconditions** | **Success**: Booking status updated. Guest notified of changes. Bed assignments saved. Communication logged. Owner dashboard reflects current status.<br><br>**Failure**: Booking status unchanged. Error displayed. Guest not notified until issue resolved. |
| **Nonfunctional Requirements** | **Performance**: Bookings dashboard loads within 2 seconds. Booking details display within 1 second. Confirmation processing completes within 3 seconds. Email/SMS delivery initiated within 10 seconds.<br><br>**Reliability**: 99.9% booking confirmation success rate. Duplicate booking prevention. Bed assignment conflict detection. Transaction logging for audit trail.<br><br>**Usability**: Dashboard sorted by urgency (check-in date proximity). Visual status indicators (color-coded badges). Quick actions accessible from summary cards. Mobile-optimized for on-the-go management. Search/filter for large booking volumes. Calendar view option.<br><br>**Real-Time Updates**: Booking status synchronized across all staff devices. Availability updates immediately after confirmation. Notifications delivered within 30 seconds.<br><br>**Communication**: Email templates professional and branded. SMS messages concise (<160 chars). All communications logged with timestamps. Guest communication history visible in booking details. |
| **Business Requirements** | BR-042: All new bookings require owner confirmation within 24 hours<br>BR-043: Guest receives confirmation notification within 5 minutes of owner confirmation<br>BR-044: SMS notifications sent for urgent events (new booking, cancellation, check-in within 24h)<br>BR-045: Owner can decline bookings only with valid reason and full refund<br>BR-046: Bed assignments required for dorm bookings before check-in<br>BR-047: Internal notes private to owner/staff (not visible to guests) |
| **Frequency of Use** | Very High (daily booking management for active properties) |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Outstanding Questions** | 1. Should system auto-confirm bookings after 24 hours if owner doesn't respond?<br>2. Should system support bulk operations (confirm multiple bookings at once)?<br>3. Should owner be able to set auto-confirmation rules (e.g., always confirm bookings >7 days out)?<br>4. Should system display revenue projections based on confirmed bookings?<br>5. Should system send reminder to owner for bookings awaiting confirmation?<br>6. What happens if owner's property becomes unavailable (maintenance, emergency)?<br>7. Should system support staff permissions (receptionist can confirm but not decline)? |

## Related Use Cases

- **UC-05: Book Accommodation** — Traveler creates bookings that owner processes in this use case
- **UC-16: Communicate With Guest** — Owner uses system messaging capabilities
- **UC-17: Check In Guest** — Staff processes check-in for confirmed bookings
- **UC-11: Manage Room Types** — Owner configures room/bed inventory that bookings utilize

## Notes

- Booking confirmation workflow critical for guest confidence and property coordination
- Bed assignment functionality unique to hostel operations (vs hotels)
- Multi-channel notifications (email + SMS) ensure owner doesn't miss bookings
- Internal notes help staff coordinate special requests and VIP treatment
- Status organization helps owner prioritize urgent bookings (near check-in dates)
- Communication history reduces misunderstandings and provides reference
- Real-time synchronization prevents double-booking across multiple staff members

## Acceptance Criteria Validation
