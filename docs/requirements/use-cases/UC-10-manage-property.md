| **Alternative Sequences** | **Step 4.6-4.8**: If Maps API cannot geocode address, System displays "Unable to locate address on map" warning, allows manual marker placement, flags for admin review<br><br>**Step 5.3**: If photo validation fails (wrong format, too large, low resolution), System displays specific error for each photo and allows owner to retry or skip<br><br>**Step 5.4**: If Cloud Storage upload fails, System retries upload up to 3 times, displays error if all retries fail, allows owner to retry later<br><br>**Step 11**: If validation fails (required fields empty, invalid data), System displays error messages highlighting problems and prevents saving<br><br>**Property Status Toggle**:<br>- Owner clicks "Pause Listing" to temporarily hide property from search results<br>- System updates property status to "Paused"<br>- System displays "Property hidden from travelers. Bookings paused."<br>- Existing confirmed bookings remain valid<br>- Owner clicks "Activate Listing" to restore visibility<br><br>**Bulk Photo Upload**:<br>- Owner selects multiple photos (up to 20) simultaneously<br>- System displays upload progress for each photo<br>- System shows success/failure status for each upload<br>- Failed uploads can be retried individually<br><br>**Photo Optimization**:<br>- System detects photo orientation issues<br>- System displays "Rotate photo?" prompt<br>- Owner rotates photo before upload<br>- System uploads corrected version to Cloud Storage<br><br>**Unsaved Changes Warning**:<br>- Owner navigates away without saving<br>- System displays "You have unsaved changes. Discard changes?"<br>- Owner confirms or cancels navigation |
| **Postconditions** | **Success**: Property information updated and saved. Photos stored in Cloud Storage. Location geocoded via Maps API. Changes visible to travelers immediately (if active). Owner receives confirmation.<br><br>**Failure**: Changes not saved. Validation errors displayed. Photos not uploaded. Owner can correct and retry. |
| **Nonfunctional Requirements** | **Performance**: Property page loads within 2 seconds. Photo uploads complete within 10 seconds per photo (max 20 photos). Map renders within 2 seconds. Save operation completes within 3 seconds.<br><br>**Storage**: Photos stored in Cloud Storage with CDN delivery. Automatic image optimization (compression, multiple sizes for responsive display). Maximum 50 photos per property.<br><br>**Usability**: Inline editing for quick updates. Autosave drafts every 30 seconds. Photo drag-and-drop supported. Visual photo gallery management. Mobile-optimized interface. Undo/redo for text changes. Rich text editor for descriptions. Preview mode shows traveler view.<br><br>**Accuracy**: Location coordinates accurate within 10 meters via Maps API. Photo URLs from Cloud Storage remain valid indefinitely. Changes published immediately without caching delay.<br><br>**SEO**: Property descriptions indexed for search. Keywords optimized. Meta descriptions generated from property highlights. |
| **Business Requirements** | BR-054: Property updates published immediately (no admin approval required for existing properties)<br>BR-055: Minimum 5 high-quality photos required before property can go live<br>BR-056: Property description minimum 100 characters, maximum 2000 characters<br>BR-057: Location accuracy verified via Maps API geocoding<br>BR-058: Property can be paused temporarily without losing bookings or data<br>BR-059: Photo captions support multiple languages for international travelers |
| **Frequency of Use** | Medium to High (owners update property details regularly, seasonal changes, special promotions) |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Outstanding Questions** | 1. Should system support video uploads for property tours?<br>2. Should system automatically suggest nearby attractions via Maps API?<br>3. Should owner be able to schedule property information updates (e.g., seasonal descriptions)?<br>4. Should system provide photo quality analysis and improvement suggestions?<br>5. Should system support 360-degree photos or virtual tours?<br>6. Should property changes require admin approval if major (address change, name change)?<br>7. Should system automatically translate descriptions to multiple languages? |

## Notes

- High-quality photos critical for traveler conversion rates
- Cloud Storage integration ensures fast photo loading via CDN
- Maps API geocoding ensures travelers can find property accurately
- Immediate publishing of updates (vs admin approval) allows owners to respond quickly to changes
- Property pause feature useful for maintenance, renovations, or seasonal closures
- Autosave prevents data loss during lengthy editing sessions
- Preview mode helps owners see property as travelers see it
- Mobile optimization important as many owners manage on-the-go

## Acceptance Criteria Validation

✓ **C1: Delivers useful result to primary actor** — Owner updates property information with immediate publication to traveler-facing listing

✓ **C2: Avoids functional decomposition** — Complete property management sequence covering all editable sections with media upload and location services

✓ **C3: Maintains black box view** — No mention of S3 buckets, CDN configuration, database updates; only describes property update behavior

✓ **C4: Primary and secondary actors identified** — Primary: Owner (manages property); Secondary: Cloud Storage (stores photos), Maps API (geocodes location)
